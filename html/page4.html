<p class="center" id="gray">This video includes 4 projects of mine. First is the Craftsman's Choice project. The task was to make an animated ad for a real company, Craftsman's Choice. The company works with houses that need redesigning or new siding. I made an ad in which a home is remodeled to look like a brand-new home. Next is the Flower Tween Project. It was a small, experimental project to test motion tweening. Next, there is the Frozen Spoon Project. I was tasked with making a looping video project, designed to fit on a billboard. Last, there is the Lip-sync project. I had to make a character and many different frames for the mouth to demonstrate animated lip syncing.</p>

<p class="center" id="gray">This includes the principles of animation, which I used in my projects to make them have better movement and quality. I used several of these strategies to improve my projects and make them appear more lifelike.</p>
