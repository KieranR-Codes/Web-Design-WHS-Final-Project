			<h2>Kieran Rose</h2>
			<p class="indent">I am Kieran Rose. I am 17 and I am currently a junior at Wayzata High School. Throughout my time here, I have taken many arts related classes and have made a lot of artworks. I also like technology related classes like computer science. I was born in Edina, and I currently live in Plymouth, Minnesota<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Minnesota#/media/File:Flag_of_Minnesota.svg" id="imglink" target="_blank"><img src="../images/flags/mnflag.png" alt="" class="flag"></a>. I have lived in Watertown, Minnesota<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Minnesota#/media/File:Flag_of_Minnesota.svg" id="imglink" target="_blank"><img src="../images/flags/mnflag.png" alt="" class="flag"></a> and Snohomish, Washington<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Washington#/media/File:Flag_of_Washington.svg" id="imglink" target="_blank"><img src="../images/flags/waflag.png" alt="" class="flag"></a>. My favorite state to live in out of those 2 is Washington<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Washington#/media/File:Flag_of_Washington.svg" id="imglink" target="_blank"><img src="../images/flags/waflag.png" alt="" class="flag"></a>.</p> 
			
			<p class="indent">Throughout my life, I have attended quite a few schools. First, I attended preschool at the Watertown-Mayer Elementary School. Then, I took K-6th grade at Totem Falls Elementary School in Snohomish. Next, I took 6-8th grade online at Wayzata Central Middle School. Then, I took 9th grade online at Minnetonka High School. Finally, I took 10th grade and 11th grade at Wayzata High School. So, in total, I have been to at least 5 different schools. </p>
			
			<p class="indent">One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games. I have a large collection of video games and many different gaming systems. I have 1000+ unique titles and over 30 different gaming systems ranging from the Atari 2600 to the PlayStation 5. So, you can say I have a small addiction to video games. I have also made a lot of artworks for Graphic Design, Animation, and Digital Photography. I have even made other websites for Computer Programming. One of my favorite works is from Graphic Design 1, called "The Line Project."<em>(Displayed on the "Best Works" page)</em>.</p>
			
			<p class="indent">I have visited quite a few places throughout my life. The ones that are most memorable for me are trips taken while I was living in Washington<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Washington#/media/File:Flag_of_Washington.svg" id="imglink" target="_blank"><img src="../images/flags/waflag.png" alt="" class="flag"></a>. Some of my favorites are Disneyland in Anaheim, California<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_California#/media/File:Flag_of_California.svg" id="imglink"target="_blank"><img src="../images/flags/caflag.png" alt="" class="flag"></a>; the Space Needle in Seattle, Washington<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Washington#/media/File:Flag_of_Washington.svg" id="imglink" target="_blank"><img src="../images/flags/waflag.png" alt="" class="flag"></a>; and a personal favorite of mine, <a href="https://shop.lavenderwind.com/" id="txtlink" target="_blank">Lavender Wind Farm</a> on Whidbey Island in Coupeville, Washington<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Washington#/media/File:Flag_of_Washington.svg" id="imglink" target="_blank"><img src="../images/flags/waflag.png" alt="" class="flag"></a>.</p>
			
			<p class="indent">I have a younger brother named Liam who also attends Wayzata High School. In my family, I have 4 pets. I have a dog named Tucker, who is a Boston terrier and rat terrier mix. Next, I have 2 parakeets named Sweetie and Tweety. One is white and blue, and the other is white and yellow. Finally, I have a gray chinchilla named Ms. Ash. She was adopted by me from one of the teachers at Wayzata Central Middle school. She had to leave, and we decided to adopt the chinchilla.</p>
