<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<center><p>All in all, This website was a lot. The first page isn't too long with just basic introduction but pages 2 and 3 are a lot. Page 2 first gives you the rankings for top 10 biggest and smallest countries. But, once you get to the interactive section, there is a lot more. There are 200 different combination for the combines size comparison sections. I would have made 300 but, by comparing the world's largest countries to the world's smallest, all of the small countries would be nearly or fully impossible to see. The time zone section was also a lot. I had to get the time zones for all 20 countries, put them into this website and account for countries that observe daylight savings time. Page 3 was also its own beast. There was a lot of information in page 3 that had to be found from a lot of different sources. Page four is kind of like page 1. Page 4 doesn't have much to offer besides the travel button.</p></center>
<br>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<center><p>This project was the first and only idea that I had in mind when starting the assignment. I knew straight away what I was going to do and how to make JavaScript sections for it. I almost instantly knew what to do on each page. There were just some things I changed later that were even better. The only downside to what I did decide to do was how long it took. I compiled 200 images in photoshop and spent almost an entire Saturday making the time zone section because of all of the research, troubleshooting and more troubleshooting that I had to do. One big help I had for page 2 was a websize calles the True Size of where you can compare the true sizez of countries. That saved at least a couple days worth of researching. Page 3 also took almost an entire day because of more research.</p></center>
