<h2>The Bigger Countries</h2>
<center><img src="outlines/usa1.png" width="" height="100px" alt="USA Country outline"></center>
<p align="center">The bigger countries are usually more familiar to most people like the USA, China and Russia. They usually have the largest populations in the world and are home to diverse landscapes. Most big countries are also not land-locked having at least one coastline. Fun Fact: The biggest country in the world is 39,086,913.6 times bigger than the smallest country.</p>
<br>

<hr>
<h2>The Smaller Countries</h2>
<center><img src="outlines/sanmarino1.png" width="" height="100px" alt="San Marino Country Outline"></center>
<p align="center">The smaller countries are usually countries that aren't as known as others like Tuvalu, Liechtenstein and Saint Kitts and Nevis. Most small countries are also island countries as well. There are some exceptions though. The smallest country in the world is a land-locked country. It also contains only one city and that city is a very important religious center. Fun Fact: If you combined the sizes of all of the 10 smallest countries in to one land mass, that land mass would still be the 171st(out of 195) smallest country in the world.</p>
